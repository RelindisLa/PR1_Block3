    Blackjack game - so the goal is to have the hightest number
    but not higher than 21
    so write a method blackjackWinner who gets a 2 dim array as a parameter
    you should calculate for every game who is the winner
    return value: an array which counts how often every player has won
    in the fist game player 2 would have won -> this means the counter of the
    returning array should be like that {0, 1, 0, 0}
    assume: every row has the same length and we do not know how many rows
    if it is a draw -> nobody gets a point for winning
